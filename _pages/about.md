First things first, I am Claire and after getting a master’s degree in management and working in the finance industry, I have decided to take up a new challenge: transition to a web development position.
<br>
<br>
## You would ask : isn’t it too difficult?

Well, let’s just say it requires a lot of dedication and at least an appetite for programming. 

* Dedication? Checked! I love attending tech meet ups, I watch tutorial on YouTube, read blog articles and I am currently attending the Wild Code School Web Development bootcamp to boost my learning path. 
* Appetite for programming? Well, I have been interested in programming for quite some time now. I have started with VBA during my studies and took on Python while I was in Japan. That is when I got really passionate about it : I became aware of all the things it would enable me to do.

More precisely, I got attracted to embedded systems and started projects on microcontrollers in MicroPython. I am also interested in the opportunities offered by programming to tackle society and environmental issues.

## You want to know more things about me?

Just to keep it short, I have listed a few things:

* I am persevering and reliable, I always do everything in my power to meet my objectives. 
* Thanks to my organisation skills and my rigor, I have managed to make the most of my previous, both personal and professional, experiences.
* I am an active and sociable person; pleasant to be with I recall.

## But I know what you are really wondering! Are my years working in Finance really lost?

Definitely not! Through my 4 years working in the finance Industry I have learnt so much! Obviously, I have acquired strong analytical and financial skills. I value teamwork too. 

However, who could have thought that I would develop so many valuable skills for web development. And let me tell you: Interpersonal, communication and commercial skills are just the beginning. You can find more details [here](/blog/finance_takeaway/).

Well, it seems like we have reached the end of the section but not the end of the topics I wish to discuss. So if you want to know more, do not hesitate contact me and follow me on social networks!
