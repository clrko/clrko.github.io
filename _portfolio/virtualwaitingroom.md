## The project

The **Virtual Waiting Room** is an award-winning front-end web application developed on June 24th - 26th 2020 during a 48h remote hackathon with **Doctolib, Dataiku** and [Wild Code School](https://www.wildcodeschool.com/en-GB) on the topic of remote healthcare.   

We decided to design a **virtual assistant for medical practitioners** to help managing the waiting time during a **tele consultation**. 

## Main Features

{% include gallery caption="These are some screenshots of the virtual waiting room" %}

* Welcoming message : 
  - A message from a welcoming bot confirms that the patient will be notified when his turn comes.

* Virtual waiting room:
  - A virtual queue which shows the user's turn among the patients and user's webcam 
  - The first counter recalls how many people are scheduled before the user
  - The second counter is an estimated waiting time
  - A chatbot confirming the personal information and asking basic check up questions

* Doctor's dashboard:
  - The practitioner can welcome a new patient
  - Inform a potential delay to all patients
