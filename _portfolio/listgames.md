The [List Games](https://listgames.netlify.app/) app has been developed during the second Wild Code School checkpoint on Front End development. 

I created a react app in which I use 2 components to display video game data from an API using axios. I decided to code using state Hooks. 

{% include gallery caption="These are some screenshot from the game" %}

The main features are the following:

- Using axios to fetch data from the <https://wild-games.herokuapp.com/api/v1> api;
- Button to remove a game on click;
- Button to filter the games by rating (breakpoint at 4.5);
- Screenshot page to display several images for a selected game.

<div style="display:flex; justify-content:space-around; margin:30px 0;">
<img src="/assets/logo/CSS3_Logo.svg"  alt="CSS3 logo" style="width: 70px; height: auto;"/>
<img src="/assets/logo/Reactjs_Logo.svg"  alt="ReactJS logo" style="width: 90px; height: auto;"/>
</div>
