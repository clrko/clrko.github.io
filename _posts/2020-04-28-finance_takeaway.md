I had not initially planned on writing a full article on this topic. It was supposed to be a small paragraph in the about me page. I had not really thought it through. 

At first, when I decided to quit my comfy consulting job and take the plunge my family and close friends would ask me this exact same question : "Are your years working in Finance really lost?". 

At this time, I was actually still trying to figure it out. I did not yet have enough hindsight to find an answer. I would answer: "No, they are not! I am just taking an other reorientation for the time being and in the long term if and when I start my own company, everything I have learnt from my previous experiences during my studies and in Finance will be useful." Yeah.. I know.. I was probably more a reassurance than to fully studied plan. 

Anyway, it took me some time to start figuring out. I had to wait until joining the Wild Code School and meeting people from this programming world though meet ups and web conference to finally find a first answer. 

No, definitely not! On the contrary I have learnt so much! 

Obviously, I have acquired strong analytical and financial skills. I value teamwork too. However, I needed to actually hear the feedbacks from my teammates from Wild Code School, to realize what was behind  I have my organizational skills . However, who could have thought that I would develop so many valuable skills for web development and let me tell you: Interpersonal, communication and commercial skills are just the beginning. You can find more details here [lien]. 


Firstly, in addition to the obvious analytical and financial related skills, who could have thought that I would have developed deep interpersonal skills and a good ability to communicate. Finance professionals needs to be able to build successful relationship with customers. it is even critical if you want to excel in business related positions like when I was working at HSBC.

What does it mean for you? It means that I will be able to communicate with the client and understand its needs efficiently. Besides, while coding, I will always keep in mind the business implications behind the project. These skills are not only critical when dealing with clients but also when working with multiple stakeholders in a projet (UX / UI Designers, cost controllers, product manager etc.) to ensure a smooth communication and avoid potential misunderstandings. 

Secondly, I have developed a capacity for innovation. Finance is not about routines and numbers but about providing accurate data to support the lifecycle and development of your business. In this case, when you need to do regular reporting, when you need to share financials to large audience, when you need to ensure the accuracy of your data etc. you need to think and rethink your processes and systems. Sometimes, I would think on a way to automize my work, other times I would need think on a new dynamic dashboard to help supporting the decision-making process related to a new business with new data. 

What does it mean for you? It means that in web development I will always try to think out of the boxes. The digital environment is changing over and over and we need to adapt and thus we need to be able to innovate and improve. 

Thirdly, I have also acquired a good knowledge and proficiency on IT softwares. Over the last year, the finance fonction has been undergoing a digital transformation.  I had the chance to be at the heart of this transformation in finance controlling, treasury and accounting and to work with both the enduser and IT project team. I had the opportunity to learn a lot about the importance of communication and training and more globally on change management.

Furthermore, I have developed strong problem-solving and decision-making skills. In the finance industry, especially during my experience in Treasury, I needed to be able to tackle complex problems as they arose either when managing the integration of new acquired entities or when working on the daily treasury management. You learn to asses efficiently the financial, compliance and technical implications of any decision to be made. 

What does it mean for you? It means that when working on a project I will not be only focusing on the technical side of things but I will be seeing the bigger picture and how they fit inside (for instance, performance, budget etc.). 



I coud say so much more on this topic but it will be a top long for this section. If you want to know more, then contact me!
